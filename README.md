# Mark-Bishop-Portfolio

## Description
This project was intended to be the first draft of my portfolio. It demonstrates knownledge and skills using flex boxes among other useful skills in regards to html and CSS. 
The goal was to build from scratch a website that can be used to attach various applications that will be developed in the future.
While the project is going to be continuous and on going as I have more content to show off, it was initialized with place holders that can be replaced with the future content.


## User story

As a student and developer
I WANT a platform to show off my completed projects
SO THAT I can show them to future employers and they can judge the skills I have already learned.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Instillation

When starting off this project, I created the necessary HTML and CSS files, created the asset folder to house all the images that utilized.

After writing the HTML code and setting up the necessary classes, I went to work trying to format the application with CSS.

The initial CSS formating was acceptable, but would fail to format correctly at smaller/larger viewports.

With minor adjustments to the main CSS and the addition of the media queries, the issue was then resolved.

While the application is incomplete, it provides a good basis to build off of in the future.
